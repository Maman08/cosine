# Contributing to RetroFlow

Welcome to RetroFlow! 🚀 We're building a **retro-style flowchart maker** during this hackathon, and we want everyone to collaborate seamlessly. This guide keeps things **minimal and flexible** so we can iterate fast. Let's build something awesome together!

## 💡 How to Contribute

### 1. Clone the Repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/agarwalvivek29/cosine.git
cd retroflow
```

### 2. Create a Branch
```sh
git checkout -b your-feature-name
```

Keep branch names short and meaningful, e.g., `ascii-export`, `drag-drop-ui`.

### 3. Code & Commit
- Keep commits small and descriptive:
  ```sh
  git commit -m "Added basic ASCII export"
  ```
- Push your branch:
  ```sh
  git push origin your-feature-name
  ```

### 4. Open a Pull Request (PR)
- Go to the GitHub repo and create a PR.
- Keep it **small and focused** (we move fast in a hackathon!).
- Add a short description of what your PR does.

## 🏗️ Development Workflow
- **Frontend:** `npm run dev`
- **Tauri Build (Native):** `npm run tauri build`
- **Quick Debugging:** Check browser console logs.

## 📦 Minimal Guidelines
- **Keep it simple:** Write clean, functional code.
- **Fast over perfect:** Ship first, refine later.
- **Sync often:** Pull latest changes frequently to avoid merge conflicts.
- **Break big tasks:** If a feature is too large, split it into multiple PRs.

## 🎯 Hackathon Focus
- 🚀 **Speed:** Deliver core features first.
- 🎨 **Retro Vibes:** Prioritize aesthetics & nostalgia.
- 🔄 **Collaboration:** Keep code modular & reusable.
